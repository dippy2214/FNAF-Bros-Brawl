Iris and Logan for the CMP208 module at abertay university.

## My Contributions and Project Challenges
My most significant contributions to this project were the dynamically moving camera and the audio system. 

### Coding Problems
The camera was an interesting project because Abertay's skateboard engine had a very barebones camera system built in, so 
capturing player data and translating that into the desired amount of screen space I wanted to capture on each frame - and 
locking this camera so that it didnt show anything past the death zones - was a very engaging challenge for me.

The audio manager was a reasonably simple task as it was simply playing the sound effects we wanted when the play functions
were called. making sure music was played through music channels and sfx through sfx channels to allow for correct overlapping
was aided by the skateboard engine's functionality.

### Development Challenges
Learning a new game engine in skateboard engine was a very unique challenge for me, and something I hadn't experienced up to
this point - especially as skateboard was still under development as we were doing this project. We made sure to report bugs to
the team working on the engine when any came up, and in some cases editted parts of the backend outselves to make some basic 
fixes. I feel like this aspect of development almost taught me the most from this whole proect, as adapting to new in house 
piece of software was a very unique learning experience for me
