# FNAF-Bros-Brawl
This is Fnaf bros brawl, a platform fighter for the PS5 (no code, unfortunately sony takes issue with that) by me, Patrick, 
Iris and Logan for the CMP208 module at abertay university.

## üõ† The Development Process
### üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Meeting The Team 
At the start of the process, we had an immediate issue - we had a group of four programmers, none of whom had any sort of training
in management roles or working in teams. The most experienced in team coordination in our group was Patrick, who had worked with Iris
before on some game jam projects. Me and Logan joined them for this project, being on friendly terms, and both of us had up to this
point little experience making full games aside from a first year module (which admittedly left something to be desired). 

Quickly we realised that to play to our strengths as a team we would benefit from each taking some core system of the game and 
working on it ourselves, with discussions over the minimal integration where required. Later in development, we would work more 
closely together as we moved to smaller features than the core systems which required more integration and teamwork. 

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è And So We're Off
I was given ownership of the camera system for the game - which had to dynamically resize to fit all players on the screen, work for 1-4 
player characters, and not show space outside of the edge of the playable area. However, immediately, for every single member of the group, 
the first major challenge of this project reared it's head: the skateboard engine.
